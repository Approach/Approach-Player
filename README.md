Approach-Player
===============

An HTML5 and Flash web player with a small, clean and extensible architecture. Licensed in Apache v2.


I am really really busy at the moment and this package is not 100% complete. It works great and most features
have been tested but a few small glitches remain from recent removals.

Player needs about 1-2 weeks of work from a good JS developer and a good graphic artist. 

Things you can do:

- Show HTML content over or in your video
- Change anything you can select with jQuery at a specific time in the video
- "Range Change", Same thing, but having a start/stop time and event layers. For the brave.
- VAST Linear Video ads are easy, but the vast plugin is not even finished at all. It's more a demo of how you dont need an ad library, but maybe a class and a handler - which it will turn into when I'm done working on major release projects.
